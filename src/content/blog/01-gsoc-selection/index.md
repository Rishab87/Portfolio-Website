Excited to share that I've been selected for Google Summer of Code this year in PyBaMM (which is under the NumFOCUS umbrella)

As a part of this program I'll be working on adding support for 3D geometry for thermal simulations in PyBaMM, starting with constant heat source and rectangular stack geometry, and building it all the way upto two way coupling with echem models with support for cylindrical and spirally wounded geometries as well.

(For context PyBaMM is a python library which is widely used in battery research and modeling)

This is an exciting project which can potentially help advance research in the field.

Thanks to all the super awesome mentors who made me feel welcome.

I'll be posting my weekly progress every 2 weeks during the coding period which is starting from 2nd June.

So stay tuned!
